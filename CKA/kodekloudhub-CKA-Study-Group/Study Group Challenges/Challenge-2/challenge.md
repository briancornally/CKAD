# Question: Service Availability During Deployment

You are responsible for managing a Kubernetes deployment of a service that relies on multiple external dependencies such as Database, Kafka, and Redis. The development team has reported that after each deployment, the service experiences a short period of 503 - Service Unavailable error. This is due to the dependencies not being fully ready during the service's boot-up phase.

## Task:

Propose a solution to ensure high availability of the service during and after deployments. Consider the following requirements:

1. Minimize the occurrence of 503 - Service Unavailable errors during deployments.

2. Ensure that the service is only considered ready when all its required dependencies are also ready.
